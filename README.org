Electric Parens is a Lisp machine written in Dart.

** Electric Lisp
Electric Lisp is a /Lisp-1/, with /fexprs/ and /delimited continuations/:

- Lisp-1 means there's just one namespace for both values and
  functions, as opposed to a Lisp-2 like Emacs Lisp.

- Fexprs are kind of like "first class macros": the primitive
  constructor of procedures is ~vau~, not ~lambda~, and it creates
  procedures that receive their arguments /unevaluated/, in addition
  to the environment at the call site.

- Delimited continuations are like purely functional macros: they
  enable more well-behaved synactic abstraction than fexprs or macros,
  and in particular they allow the concise expression of /monadic/
  design patterns.
